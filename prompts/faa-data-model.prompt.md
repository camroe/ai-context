# FAA Data Model Definition

Create TypeScript interfaces and types for FAA repair station data including:

1. **Repair Station Entity**: Certificate details, class, capabilities
2. **Maintenance Records**: Service dates, aircraft types, technician info
3. **Compliance Status**: Regulatory compliance tracking
4. **Audit Trail**: Change history and timestamps
5. **Validation Rules**: Data constraints and FAA requirements

Generate interfaces with JSDoc comments explaining each field and its FAA requirements.
